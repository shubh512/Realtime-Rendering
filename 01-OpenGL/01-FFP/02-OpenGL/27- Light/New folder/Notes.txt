   1. enable  GL_NORMALIZE by using glEnable function or
   2. enable GL_RESCALE_NORMAL by using glEnable function

   To specify normal use glNormal *functions

2. FFP opengl supports 8 lights. Numberesd from GL_LIGHT0 to GL_LIGHT7. By default GL_LIGHT0 is enabled that's why 
even though we don't use light yet objects are visible without enabling any light. 
	All of the 10 properties are used glLightfv function.
	There are about 10 important properties of light.
	GL_AMBIENT
	GL_DIFFUSE
	GL_SPECULAR

	Next three are concerned with spotlights.
	GL_SPOT_CUTOFF
	GL_SPOT_DIRECTION
	GL_EXPONENT

	Next three are about attenuation.
	GL_CONSTANT_ATTENUATION
	GL_CONSTANT_LINEAR_ATTENUATION
	GL_CONSTANT_QUADRATIC_ATTENUATION

	
GL_LIGHT0 is white. Therefore when no colour is assigned the object will look white. 
BY default GL_LIGHT1 to GL_LIGHT7 GL_DIFFUSE and GL_SPECULAR are black. 

**Enabling light only is not enough, there is a global lighting switch which has to be enabled to enable all default lighting. 

There are 4 points to consider in lighting model:
1. Whether to consider outer surface or inner surface-> GL_LIGHT_MODEL_TWO_SIDE -> by default lighting model is not two sided
2. Whether to consider global ambient light or not-> specified by GL_LIGHT_AMBIENT
3. Whether to consider by default opengl assumes viewer is infinitely away and looking into the screen.
